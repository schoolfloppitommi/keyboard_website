          <h2>abko keyboard</h2>
          <p>My First keyboard of 2023, this is an easy to mod keyboard. It came with kailh box switches and a full keyboard sized board. the pcb was north-facing and it had decent stabilizers</p>

          <h2>rk71</h2>
          <p>It came with a south-facing pcb and foam cushioners, stabilizers were trash though, it came with red linear switches which I paired with o rings and it sounds awesome after I lubed them</p>

          <h3> Epomaker GK75</h3>
          <p>The build quality is again, insane and it has a transparent smoky plastic case and has dual stage risers, the knob has a tactile feel and has good sound too. It comes with gateron optical switches which are very fast, lastly, the keycaps are thicker and more premium than all the keyboards in this budget keyboard list</p>

          <h3> Royal Kludge H81 </h3>
          <p>It is the perfect keyboard form factor that saves space and its asthetics are even more beautiful than the tecware phantom+ 87, this keyboard feautures and knob and premium keycaps and uses a polycarbonate plate that only premium keyboards come with.</p>

          <h3> Tecware Phantom+ 87 </h3>
          <p>The build quality is insane for the price and it looks beautiful. The quality mostly comes from the inside of the keyboard with 2 layers of foam that dampens the sound</p>

          <h3> Redragon K530 Pro </h3>
          <p>Personally, many MANY people are buying this keyboard, it's super cheap and has good rgb, it is easy to modify too.</p>

          <h3> Ractous RTK61P </h3>
          <p>The sound without modding sounds pretty bad but it comes with pudding keycaps. It has tones of RGB modes! </p>
